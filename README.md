# Enigma
Project for Applied Java classes. The program represets simple version of the enigma machine from past. Code seems a little bit messy but still readable.


Roughly, you can select Rotors (specific permutations of letters) in the way you want 
(order and starting position). The rotors, thanks to movement system, create additional
Caesar cipher between each other. Remember to restart machine when you want to start
something new. Please be careful with restarts, since this method, in fact, creates 
new cipher texts in the txt format.
