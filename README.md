# Enigma
Project for Applied Java classes. The program represets simple version of the enigma machine from past. Code seems a little bit messy but still readable.


Roughly, you can select Rotors (specific permutations of letters) in the way you want 
(order and starting position). The rotors, because of the movement system, create additional
Caesar cipher between each other. Due to the main rule, remember to restart machine when you want to begin
new encryption/decryption process.
